In this folder you find the bash scripts to compute times at which a new element occurs (novs.sh) and compute the heaps of a sequence (heaps.sh) 
About heaps.sh: first column is the time i.e. a sequence of ordered numbers from 1 to the length of the sequence, the second column counts at each time
the number of different elements. 
Run them in the same folder in which che sequences are placed. Or ask chatGPT how to adjust them according to your needs.
