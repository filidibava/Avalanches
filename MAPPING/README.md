Here you find the description of the python codes used for the mapping:
-mapping_stesso_vocab.ipynb maps the umt sequences into the vocabulary of the original dataset: note that it needs a python dictionary that sends each element of the vocabulary of the
corpus into an integer.
-fitting heaps.ipynb creates a file containing  the estimates of the values of nu,rho and N0 for each text in the corpus
